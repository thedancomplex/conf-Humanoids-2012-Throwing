\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The creation of a reliable humanoid throwing method was completed. 
This allowed the Hubo to complete its goal of becoming the first adult-size humanoid robot to throw the first pitch at a Major League Baseball game.
Three methods of creating a viable throw were explored and tested: human-robot mapping via motion capture, sparse reachable map based trajectory generation and a key-frame based method.  
Though the key-frame based method was the simplest it also proved to be the most viable.  
The balancing controller ensured stability of the system throughout the throw.  
With the addition of a high powered wrist and having the robot step forward when it throws created conditions for a successful and reliable pitch.  More information and media about this event is available on this papers home page http://danlofaro.com/Humanoids2012/
