\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The Hubo did complete its goal of becoming the first adult-size humanoid robot to throw the first pitch at a Major League Baseball game.  Three methods of creating a viable throw were explored and tested: human-robot mapping via motion capture, sparse reachable map based trajectory generation and a key-frame based method.  Though the key-frame based method was the simplest it proved to be the most viable.  The balancing controller ensured stability of the system throughout the throw.  With the addition of a high powered wrist and having the robot step forward when it throws created conditions for a successful pitch.
