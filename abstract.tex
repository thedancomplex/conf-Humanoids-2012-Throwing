This document describes the three different approaches to having an adult-size humanoid robot throw the first pitch at a Major League Baseball game.  The approaches include kinematic mapping using a motion capture system to capture a human's throwing motion then mapping that to the humanoid robot adult-size humanoid robot Hubo.  The second approach is a fully automated approach that uses the sparse reachable map to provide viable full body throwing trajectories to give the end effector the desired velocity.  The third approach borrows from the animation industry.  Key frames of the desired trajectory is constructed by hand.  The time between each key frame is defined by the user.  A forth order interpolation method is used to smoothly move from key frame to key frame while limiting the jerk.  Each method is analyzed and tested in simulation and on physical hardware.  Based on the latter tests one method was chosen to throw a successful first pitch.
