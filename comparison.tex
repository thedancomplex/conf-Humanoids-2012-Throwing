\section{Method Comparison}\label{sec:comparison}
All three methods described were shown to be stable during the throwing motion and can successfully throw a ball.  Table~\ref{table:comp} shows the end-effector (EEF) velocity, joint failure rate and stability of the three different methods of end-effector velocity control used in this paper human-robot joint mapping (MoCap), SRM based and key-frame.

The SRM technique worked well however the high jerk on each of the joints (creating large torques) caused the motor controller to over torque and shutdown 10\% of the time.  The pitch needs to work 100\% of the time thus this method is not well suited for the experiment.  Both the human-robot joint mapping via MoCap and key-frame based methods consistantly worked and stayed stable.  A secondary objective is to have the throwing motion be overhand like a regular Major League Baseball pitcher.  Due to the constraints placed on the joint mapping of the MoCap method an over arm throw would be impossiable due to the robot's $\pm180^o$ joint limitations.  The key-frame method was chosen as the method to throw the ball.  Section~\ref{sec:finalDesign} discribes the modifications to the system to allow it to throw the pitch the desired distance.
