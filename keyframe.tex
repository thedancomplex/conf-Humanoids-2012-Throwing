\subsection{Key-Frame Motion}

Key-frame motion profiles for humanoid robots borrows from the animation industries long used animation techniques.  When making an animation the master animator will create the character in the most important (or key) poses.  The apprentice animators will draw all of the frames between motions.  We borrowed this technique when we posed the robot in the desired pose, record the values in joint space, in place of the apprentice animators forth order interpolation methods were used to make smooth trajectories between poses.  Forth order interpolation was used in order to limit the jerk on each of the joints.  The resulting trajectory is a smooth well defined motion.
