In early February 2012 the director of the Philadelphia Science Festival asked the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL)\footnote{Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab: http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu}\label{foot:dasl} if they could have their adult-size humanoid robot Jaemi Hubo throw the ceremonial first pitch at the second annual \textit{Science Night at the Ballpark}.  On April 28th, 2012 Hubo successfully threw the first pitch at the Philadelphia Phillies Vs. Chicago Cubs game, see Fig.~\ref{fig:hubo-throw}.

%The PhillieBot\footnote{PhillieBot Video: http://youtu.be/ShId-vZ-ZEY} made by the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania was the robot that threw the first pitch at the first annual Philadelphia Science Festival \textit{Science Night at the Ballpark} in 2011.  

Hubo was the first adult-size humanoid robot to throw the first pitch at a Major League baseball game.  
This document describes how this was done via the analyses and tests of three different approaches and the resulting final design.
Section~\ref{sec:background} gives a brief introduction to work already done in the field as well as states the requirements for the pitch.
Section~\ref{sec:methodology} describes the three different methods tested where:
Section~\ref{sec:sec:balance} discusses the balancing methods and criteria used.
Section~\ref{sec:sec:mocap} describes the kinematic mapping approach that uses a motion capture system to capture a human's throwing motion then mapping that to an adult-size humanoid robot.  
Section~\ref{sec:sec:srm} describes a fully automated approach that uses the sparse reachable map (SRM) to provide viable full body throwing trajectories to provide the end effector with the desired velocity\cite{dlofaro-srm}.
Section~\ref{sec:sec:keyframe} describes the final method explored which is based on key-frame trajectories.
Section~\ref{sec:comparison} Compares the tests and analyses of each of the methods.
Section~\ref{sec:finalDesign} describes in detail the remainder of the hurtals needed to be overcome to throw a successful pitch using the method chosen in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}.
Finally Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} gives final thoughts and possible improvements for future years.
