\section{Introduction}

In early February 2012 the director of the Philadelphia Science Festival asked the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL)\footnote{Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab: http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu}\label{foot:dasl} if they could have their full-size humanoid Jaemi Hubo throw the ceremonial first pitch at the second annual \textit{Science Night at the Ballpark}.  
On April 28th, 2012 Hubo successfully threw the first pitch at the Philadelphia Phillies vs. Chicago Cubs game, see Fig.~\ref{fig:hubo-throw}.  According to the USA Today were 45,196 fans at the game and thousands
more were watching it on television.

%The PhillieBot\footnote{PhillieBot Video: http://youtu.be/ShId-vZ-ZEY} made by the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania was the robot that threw the first pitch at the first annual Philadelphia Science Festival \textit{Science Night at the Ballpark} in 2011.  

Hubo was the first full-size humanoid to throw the inaugural pitch at a Major League Baseball game.  
This task poses challenges in the area of fully-body locomotion, coordination and stabilization that must be addressed.
This paper describes how the latter was done via the analyses/tests of three different approaches and the resulting final design.
Section~\ref{sec:background} gives a brief introduction to work already done in the field as well as states the requirements for the pitch.
Section~\ref{sec:methodology} describes the three different methods tested where:
Section~\ref{sec:sec:balance} discusses the balancing methods and criteria used.
Section~\ref{sec:sec:mocap} describes the human-robot kinematic mapping approach that uses a motion capture system to capture a human's throwing motion then mapping that to a full-size humanoid.  
Section~\ref{sec:sec:srm} describes a fully automated approach that uses the sparse reachable map (SRM) to provide viable full body throwing trajectories with the desired end effector velocity\cite{dlofaro-srm}.
Section~\ref{sec:sec:keyframe} describes the final method explored which is based on key-frame trajectories.
Section~\ref{sec:comparison} compares the tests and analyses of each of the methods.
Section~\ref{sec:finalDesign} describes the finial design in detail and the modifications needed to make the robot's pitch reliable.
Finally Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} gives final thoughts and possible improvements for future years.
