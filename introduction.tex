In early February 2012 the director of the Philadelphia Science Festival asked the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL)\footnote{Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab: http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu}\label{foot:dasl} if they could have their adult-size humanoid robot Jaemi Hubo throw the ceremonial first pitch at the second annual \textit{Science Night at the Ballpark}.  On April 28th, 2012 Hubo successfully threw the first pitch at the Philadelphia Phillies Vs. Chicago Cubs game, see Fig.~\ref{fig:hubo-throw}.  This document describes, analyses and tests three different approaches to having an adult-size humanoid robot throw the first pitch.
